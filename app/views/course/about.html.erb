      Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by how the interplay of planetary energies is reflected in our psyches. I began my teaching journey in my mid 20’s, offering a beginner class in Astrology at the Discovery Center in Chicago. After teaching that class for 5 years, I created a private astrology class for some of my devoted students. That group of amazing students helped solidify my absolute love of sharing my astrological knowledge. After 3 years I decided to expand my base even further, offering classes for all levels of astrologers and private readings. For the last 3 years, I have been building a Chicago based community of Astrologers through my Meetup and Facebook groups: “The Chicago Astrology and Esoteric Study Group”. 
      <br><br>
      I now offer regular, once a month, Saturday Meetups at Chicago’s best occult bookstore, Alchemy Arts. I also continue to teach at the Discovery Center every other month. And I offer over one hundred classes and readings a year out of my home. I am constantly updating my personal knowledge base to give insightful, accurate and down to earth natal and transit readings to my clients. I am always growing through my practice, and love to bring my clients and my students with me on my journey of knowledge.
